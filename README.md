# sandbox

Sandbox is my blog/documentation of playing around with Scala and related 
features, frameworks, etc. 

The blog will be saved in `/docs` directory. Hopefully, I can keep it up. And it
will be fun for me documenting something new that I learnt with Scala. Otherwise,
this will be like my other reference repositories - untouch forever. 

This sandbox is built with the following:

- Scala version 2.12.1
- SBT version 0.13.13
