# sandbox

Sandbox is my blog/documentation of playing around with Scala and related 
features, frameworks, etc. 

The blog will be saved in `/docs` directory in the equivalent project. 
Hopefully, I can keep it up. And it will be fun for me documenting something new 
that I learnt with Scala. Otherwise, this will be like my other reference 
repositories - untouch forever.
