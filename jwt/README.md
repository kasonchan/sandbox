# Sandbox JWT

This repository is created for playing around with scala and jwt. In this 
repository we are going to explore the jwt-scala.

In order to use the library, we need to import the following in our 
`build.sbt`.

```
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "com.pauldijou" %% "jwt-play-legacy" % "0.14.1"
)
```
