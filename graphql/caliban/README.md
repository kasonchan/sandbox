# graphql-caliban

This repository is a sandbox playing with graphql with caliban. 

> Caliban is a purely functional library for creating GraphQL backends in Scala. 
> It relies on Magnolia to automatically derives GraphQL schemas from your data 
> types, Fastparse to parse queries and ZIO to handle various effects.

- To render schema: `GQL.api.render`
